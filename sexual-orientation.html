    <h2>Your Child Is Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual</h2>
    <p>Hearing your child’s sexual orientation can bring up a mix of emotions — even if you’ve always supported LGBTQ+ rights. It’s normal to feel unsure about what to say or how to act. Remember: your child trusted you with something deeply personal. Your support now can make all the difference.</p>

    <h3>The Power of Support</h3>
    <p>Research shows LGBTQ+ youth with supportive familes experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Better mental health</li>

      <li>Stronger relationships at home</li>
      <li>Greater success in school and later life</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many parents find this journey deepens honesty, love, and connection with their children.</p>
